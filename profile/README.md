## 🌱 Join Us
We focus on incorporating human factors into security and privacy and designing **usable** online services. Our current work builds systems that deliver practical privacy/security mechanisms for users while **minimizing abuse**.

We welcome students interested in the human aspects of privacy and security who enjoy tinkering with systems. If you are a student at **IIT Kharagpur** and feel strongly about making the digital world private and secure, please reach out by email.

> 💡 It’s especially helpful if you’ve taken the **Usable Security and Privacy** course.
